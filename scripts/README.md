# Scripts 
This folder contains all the scripts used to create **S-SPHAR**, the **S**ynthetic **S**urveillance **P**erspective **H**uman **A**ction **R**ecognition Dataset.

## Descriptions
### Video Generation
- `generate_video.py` can be used to generate videos based on a folder of image frames generated by the simulator. It can also be configured to create splitscreen videos (2 in 1 or 4 in 1) containing configurable video contents like real-images, mask-images, half-transparent mask overlays and class-specific segmentation masks. This is great for generating synchronized side-by-side comparison videos. It can also be configured to generate short cutted videos for each bounding box occuring in the videos (bounding box tubes). These spatiotemporally cropped videos can be used for training an action recognition model with video-level annotations.
- `helper_classes.py` and `helper_functions.py` provide functionality needed for `generate_video.py` and need to be placed in the same folder to be properly imported.
