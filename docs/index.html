      "description":"S-SPHAR is a synthetically generated video dataset for human action recognition. Its main purpose is to support research in the application area of analyzing activities on public places. In this domain, most cameras will share a similar mounting angle and perspective, which we will call the surveillance perspective from now on. In S-SPHAR, all videos are shot from this or a similar perspective. The videos have been generated using a self-made simulation built using the Unity game engine and characters and animations from Mixamo. This Repository contains all videos of the S-SPHAR dataset.",
